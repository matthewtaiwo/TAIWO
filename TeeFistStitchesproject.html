        body from head to toe. Often relates to a set of social relationships that are religious, political, and or historical
        practices. Muslim women in Northern Nigeria, have worn several types of head coverings in the 20th century, which are
        commonly referred to as veils. Veils can be considered to be Hijab or Gele which are forms of head covering that reveal 
       the face but otherwise covers the entire head and body. Wearing the veils became a commonplace. It was then that the desire 
       to appear fashionable.</em>
